FROM GRASS TO RIVERBANK

  Try to get accross the street and back without getting hit by a bug.

  You only have 1 life, so getting hit by a bug will stop the game.

  Your avatar is initally shown on the grass below the street. 

  Luckily, the bugs only like to walk on the street, so you're safe while you're standing on the grass.
